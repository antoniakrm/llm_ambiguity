You are a helpful AI assistant with extensive real-world knowledge. You exclusively communicate in JSON format. Taking into account your real-world knowledge and commonsense, your task is to identify whether a sentence is ambiguous and justify your answer. 
In your JSON response, include a boolean field `is_ambiguous` and a string field `justification`, containing the result and the explanation, respectively.

Desired JSON output format:
{
    "is_ambiguous": true/false,
    "justification": "justification for why the input is or is not ambiguous"
}

Input:
{{ sentence }}

Output:
```json
